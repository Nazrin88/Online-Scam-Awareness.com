            <h3>Job Scam</h3>
            <p>Online scams have become a big threat and job sites have not been spared either. If a job promises high pay for little work, be leery. That’s a common sign of a job scam. Some other key signs of a fraudulent job advertisement include request for money remittance prior to any job interview or confirmation of job offer before any face-to-face job interview. A daily reported in September that a group of 18 Malaysians were duped of RM180,025 by a man who had allegedly offered them “jobs” at a casino in Cambodia.</p>

            <h3>Macau Scam</h3>
            <p>In Malaysia, Macau Scams are categorised as telecommunications fraud. Usually, the victim gets a phone call from an official-sounding person and is told he or she has outstanding loan payments or unpaid fines. The victim panics and willingly follows the instructions of the “official”, including transferring huge sums of money into another party’s bank accounts, to supposedly “avoid getting into trouble”. Bernama on Nov 19 reported a total of 1,420 out of 2,676 Macau Scam cases have been charged in court between January and October, involving losses amounting to RM256 million. Please remember to not transfer cash into other bank accounts following telephone conversations with strangers!</p>

            <h3>BigPay Scam</h3>
            <p>You could get a call or SMS (short message service) from someone pretending to be a BigPay staff member, who may mislead you into giving away important information, especially one-time password (OTP) number. Fraudsters might go the extra mile to impersonate them by using their logos as their profile image. Some of them might call you via WhatsApp call. Recently, @bigpaymeapp Twitter account was flooded with complaints from its users about getting a scam call saying that they won RM3,000. “Hi there. Thank you for mentioning us here. The number which contacted you via WhatsApp is not from BigPay and neither will we reach out via WhatsApp to request for any users’ personal details/ OTP. Please report and block the number right away. “As of now, there has not been a data leak/breach. These scammers are keying in mobile numbers at random to assess who has a BigPay account,” it replied on Twitter.</p>

            <h3>Online Money Lending Apps</h3>
            <p>The Personal Data Protection Department (PDPD) has opened investigation papers on six unlicensed money lending apps that are suspected of misusing personal data. The six applications are Asialend, Dreamlend, iPayfren, iPinjaman, Helplend4u and GoCash4u. “All such online applications were found to have accessed and copied people’s information, including personal information unrelated to loans without borrowers’ consent,” the statement read. Those whose personal data have been misused by such unlicensed online money lending apps are urged to contact the PDPD enforcement division through email at penguatkuasaan@pdp.gov.my or the personal data protection system (daftar.pdp.gov.my) to assist investigations. PDPD advises Malaysians to be more careful when applying for loans online, especially when giving downloaded apps permission to access information, to avoid personal data being misused by irresponsible parties. In this time of great difficulty, it is important to remain vigilant so as to not be deceived by their tactics and tricks. Do not disclose your personal financial information to any suspicious parties. Do not be scammed into transferring money to unknown third-party accounts. Please check with the bank on the unknown third-party accounts. If you receive any unsolicited telephone calls, SMS or emails, protect yourself by not responding to any such unsolicited contact. Even Bank Negara Malaysia will never request for personal information or clarification via SMS, telephone call, email, social media or any messaging app.</p>
