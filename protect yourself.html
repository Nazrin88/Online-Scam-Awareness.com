            <h3>Be alert to the fact that scams exsist</h3>
            <p>When dealing with uninvited contacts from people or businesses, whether it's over the phone, by mail, email, in person or on a social networking site, always consider the possibility that the approach may be a scam. Remember, if it looks too good to be true, it probably is.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="box">
            
            <h3>Know who you are dealing with</h3>
            <p>If you've only ever met someone online or are unsure of the legitimacy of a business, take some time to do a bit more research. Do a Google image search on photos or search the internet for others who may have had dealings with them. If a message or email comes from a friend and it seems unusual or out of character for them, contact your friend directly to check that it was really them that sent it</p>
        </div>

        <div class="box">
        
            <h3>Keep your personal details secure</h3>
            <p> Put a lock on your mailbox and shred your bills and other important documents before throwing them out. Keep your passwords and pin numbers in a safe place. Be very careful about how much personal information you share on social media sites. Scammers can use your information and pictures to create a fake identity or to target you with a scam.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="box">
            
            <h3>Keep your mobile device and computer secure</h3>
            <p>Always use password protection, don’t share access with others (including remotely), update security software and back up content. Protect your WiFi network with a password and avoid using public computers or WiFi hotspots to access online banking or provide personal information.</p>
        </div>
        
         <div class="box">
            
            <h3>Choose your password carefully</h3>
            <p>Choose passwords that would be difficult for others to guess and update them regularly. A strong password should include a mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols. Don’t use the same password for every account/profile, and don’t share your passwords with anyone.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="box">
            
            <h3>Review your privacy and security setting on social media </h3>
            <p>If you use social networking sites, such as Facebook, be careful who you connect with and learn how to use your privacy and security settings to ensure you stay safe.  If you recognise suspicious behaviour, clicked on spam or have been scammed online, take steps to secure your account and be sure to report it</p>
        </div>

        <div class="box">
            
            <h3>Beware of any request for your details and money</h3>
            <p>Never send money or give credit card details, online account details or copies of personal documents to anyone you don’t know or trust. Don't agree to transfer money or goods for someone else: money laundering is a criminal offence</p>
        </div>

        <div class="box">
            
            <h3>Beware of unusual payment request</h3>
            <p>Scammers will often ask you to use an unusual payment method, including preloaded debit cards, gift cards, iTunes cards or virtual currency such as Bitcoin.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="box">
            
            <h3>Becareful when shopping online</h3>
            <p>Beware of offers that seem too good to be true, and always use an online shopping service that you know and trust. Think twice before using virtual currencies (like Bitcoin) - they do not have the same protections as other transaction methods, which means you can’t get your money back once you send it.</p>
